# Health Checkup Reports

This directory contains generated health check reports for monitored servers.

## Report Types

- `<ip>_health.log` - System health report (memory, disk, CPU, network)
- `<ip>_services.log` - Service status report (critical services, Docker containers)

## Monitoring Live Progress

```bash
# Monitor all health checks
tail -f ./health_reports/*_health.log

# Monitor all service checks
tail -f ./health_reports/*_services.log

# Monitor specific server
tail -f ./health_reports/10.49.74.104_health.log
```

## Viewing Reports

```bash
# List all reports
ls -lh ./health_reports/

# View a specific report
cat ./health_reports/<ip>_health.log

# Search for issues
grep -i "error\|fail\|not running" ./health_reports/*.log
```

Reports are automatically generated when you run the health check workflow.
